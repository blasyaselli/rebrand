      <div class="download-case-study__quote-author"> Reg Dyck, IT Division Manager, WorkSafe BC</div>
      <div class="download-case-study__description">Dedicated to promoting workplace health and safety, WorkSafeBC knew it needed a better way to manage workflows, projects and the overall organization – comprised of 3,000 staff members supporting more than 100,000 employers. Too many manual systems left WorkSafeBC struggling to maintain quality and timeliness. With operations management software built with K2, workflows for everything from travel requests and claim filing to invoice approval and records retrieval have been developed, saving WorkSafeBC time and money. Plus, new approval processes have greatly increased transparency.

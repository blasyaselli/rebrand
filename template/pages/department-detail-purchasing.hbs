      <div class="download-case-study__quote-author"> Filip Legény, IT Project Manager, Dalkia</div>
      <div class="download-case-study__description">Dalkia, an energy and environmental company that raises 10,000 to 12,000 invoices in Slovakia each year, found itself struggling with a manual purchase order management process. Not only did the process take too much time, but engineers could unknowingly raise POs for parts that had been discontinued or get a digit wrong and order the wrong part. Using purchase order software and procurement workflow from K2, Dalkia automated the process, which reduced manual errors, increased visibility into which items the company had in stock, and saved the company a great deal of time and money.</div>
